### Hey welcome to my blog.  
Let me briefly introduce myself and explaine what this blog is all about.

#### Who am I?
My name is Sebastian Baum and I am working as a professional software developer for [ion2s GmbH](http://www.ion2s.com/) in Darmstadt near Frankfurt a.M. in Germany.

I'm luckily working in a very versatile web based project where I get in contact with a variety of technology. Almost every day there are challenging tasks where I learn a lot of new things. And I'm not limited to just coding. Since our team is a small one I also have operational tasks like server administration and configuration.

#### What is this blog all about?
Maybe you also have been happy one day because you found solutions to your problems/tasks online in a forum or someone's blog. That happend to me a lot of times, too. So I want to contribute by documenting and sharing solutions that helped *me*. And maybe there will be a solution or some inspiration to help *you*. If that is the case or you can tell me how to do something better and easier then feel free to leave a comment.

#### What to expect?
I will mainly blog about:

* Linux
* [Java (EE)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/overview/index.html)
* [Neo4J](http://neo4j.com/)
* [Docker](http://www.docker.com/)
* ...

And I won't blog anything about Windows. ;-)
